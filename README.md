## google-homepage
Some stuff i have been working on as part of The Odin Project. I have enjoyed using different styling techiniques i am currently learning 
along with trying to use flexbox for positioning of some elements to create a responsive page(as much as i could anyway!).


Strengths: 
1) I found this project to be fun to start the Odin project off with =) 
2) I learned quite a lot in regards to css positioning and different styling attributes.
3) Finally this project gave me a good foundation in researching solutions to problems that appeared whilst developing the page.


Inconsistencies:

There are a few elements within the google homepage as well as the results page that dont match exactly with google -

1) The results page has a search result showing images that match up to the search. As far as I know google have recently changed this
 feature of the results and have instead opted for another column giving relevant information to the right of the search results.
2) The positioning of certain elements on both pages are incorrect. this is a result of going on rough estimations on what the positions were (using Chromes DevTools is taking easy street as the in-browser
tool allows you to explore the code on pages, making it far easier to imitate a webpage).
3)The results page border between the search bar and results should extend across the page.
